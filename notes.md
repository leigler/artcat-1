# Notes

- general structure is defined w/ `column` classes, `column full-width` acts as a header/distinguisher (the only outlier is the `lightbox.html` example, which is organized via the `content` class and introduces the image grid via inline-block elements)

- lightbox is a separate `absolute`ly placed div 

- types: 
	- `artist.html` : two column, w/ `full-width` break points, combination of text and image fields
	- `exhibitions.html` : two column, w/ headers, image + subtitles
	- `image-lists.html` : two column, `full-width` initial title, 4 column image grid + subtitle + description
	- `index.html` : two column: single column in-use
	- `lightbox.html` : no column, full width, image lists w/ captions
	- `lists.html` : two column: single column in-use, image-less lists
	- `two-column.html` : two column: use of column break
